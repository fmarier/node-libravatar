Here is an easy way to make use of the federated [Libravatar](http://www.libravatar.org)
avatar hosting service from within your node.js applications. It is inspired by
[Emerson Macedo](http://codificando.com/)'s [Gravatar library](https://github.com/emerleite/node-gravatar).

See the [project page](https://github.com/fmarier/node-libravatar) for the issue tracker and downloads.

## Instalation

To install using npm, simply do this:

    $ npm install libravatar

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/libravatar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/libravatar/)

## Usage

To generate the correct avatar URL based on someone's email address, use the
following:

    var libravatar = require('libravatar');
    libravatar.url({ email: 'person@example.com', size: 96, default: 'mm', https: false },
      function (error, avatar_url) {
        console.log('<img src="' + avatar_url + '">');
      });

See the [Libravatar documentation](http://wiki.libravatar.org/api) for more
information on the special values for the "default" parameter.
